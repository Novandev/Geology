            <p>Fracking is a process in which shale are blasted at high pressure with a mixture of sand water and chemicals to reliase the natural gas contained within</p>
            <p>The depth at which fracking takes places is between 1-2 miles underground to reach the shale that contains gas.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Why is fracking dangerous?</button>
          <div class="faqpanel">
            <p>Due to the depth at which fracking occurs, as well at the chemicals ad additives used by organizations who perform fracking to break down the shale, these chemicals (as well as the natural gas released during the proccess) can leak into ground water, potentially poisoning a communities groundwater. This can also leak into tributaries, streams and other water sources</p>
